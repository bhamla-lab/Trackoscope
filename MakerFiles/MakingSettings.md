## Laser Cutting
DXF files provided are in the inches unit. They can be preppped for laser cutting using a vector modifying software such as Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator. These files are meant for 1/4" material thickness. Files that end in "TAP" have smaller hole sizes for tapping instead of clearance holes to be used with nuts and bolts. The files ending in "Spacer" are optional and can be cut if extra height is needed. There are two motor mount files. Depending on your application, the tall mount can be used.
